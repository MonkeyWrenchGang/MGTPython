# Module 4 
----

Matplotlib and Seaborn are the most common visualization libraries in Python that allow you to create a wide range of charts, plots, and graphs to explore and communicate your data.

Matplotlib is a low-level library that provides a high degree of flexibility and control over the appearance of your visualizations. With Matplotlib, you can create a wide range of 2D and 3D plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and many others. Matplotlib is widely used in scientific research and data analysis, and is often used as the foundation for other visualization libraries in Python.

Seaborn is a higher-level library that provides a more streamlined and user-friendly interface for creating visualizations. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a wide range of built-in themes and color palettes that make it easy to create professional-looking visualizations with minimal effort. Seaborn is particularly useful for creating statistical graphics, such as box plots, violin plots, and regression plots, and it includes several tools for visualizing categorical data and time series data.

In this module we'll dive into both Matplotlib and Seaborn.
