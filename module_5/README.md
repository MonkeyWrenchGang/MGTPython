# Module 5 - Exploratory Analysis 
----

Exploratory analysis is a KEY part of data analysis and visualization in any analtyics project. In this module we are going to put our filtering, aggregation and visualization skills use and dive into formalizing our exploratory analysis.

- Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating statistical graphics. Seaborn includes a wide range of built-in themes and color palettes that make it easy to create professional-looking visualizations with minimal effort. Seaborn is particularly useful for creating statistical graphics, such as box plots, violin plots, and regression plots, and it includes several tools for visualizing categorical data and time series data.

- Matplotlib is a low-level library that provides a high degree of flexibility and control over the appearance of your visualizations. With Matplotlib, you can create a wide range of 2D and 3D plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and many others. Matplotlib is widely used in scientific research and data analysis, and is often used as the foundation for other visualization libraries in Python.
