Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools that make it simple to work with structured data. Pandas is widely used in data science and machine learning projects, and is a crucial tool for anyone working with data in Python.

Once you have your data loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, you can use a wide range of tools to manipulate and analyze it. Some of the most commonly used tools include:

- head() and tail(): these methods allow you to view the first or last few rows of a DataFrame.
i- nfo(): this method provides basic information about the DataFrame, such as the number of rows and columns, the data types of each column, and whether any columns contain missing values.
- describe(): this method provides summary statistics for each numeric column in the DataFrame, including the mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.
- groupby(): this method allows you to group rows in the DataFrame by one or more columns, and then apply an aggregate function (such as sum(), mean(), or count()) to each group.
- query(): this method allows you to filter rows in the DataFrame based on a boolean expression.
These are just a few of the many tools available in Pandas. As you become more familiar with the library, you'll find that it provides many powerful and flexible tools for working with data in Python.

## Anaconda 
Anaconda is the most popular distribution of the Python programming language. It provides a comprehensive installation of tools and libraries for data analysis, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and many others.


One of the key benefits of Anaconda is that it simplifies the process of installing and managing these tools and libraries on your system. Anaconda comes with its own package manager, called conda, which allows you to easily install, update, and remove packages from your system.

> Use anaconda if you want a LOCAL installation of Python

## All about Google Colabratory AKA "Colab"

Colab, short for "Google Colaboratory," is a free cloud-based platform for data science and machine learning research. Colab provides a Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write, edit, and run Python code directly in your web browser.

Colab comes with a variety of pre-installed libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and many others. This means you can start working on your projects right away, without needing to set up your own development environment.

One of the key benefits of Colab is that it provides free access to powerful computing resources, including high-end CPUs and GPUs. This makes it possible to run complex computations and train machine learning models without needing to invest in expensive hardware.

Another benefit of Colab is that it makes it easy to collaborate with others on your projects. You can share your Colab notebooks with others, and they can run and modify your code directly in their own web browser.

Colab also provides access to Google Drive, allowing you to store and access your data and notebooks in the cloud. This means you can work on your projects from any device with an internet connection, without needing to worry about transferring files between different computers.

> We'll make extensive use of Colab, but don't worry everything in colab can be done in Anaconda too!
