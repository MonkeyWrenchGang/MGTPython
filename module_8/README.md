# Image Analysis 
----

Image analysis is the process of extracting useful information from digital images using computational techniques. Image analysis is widely used in a variety of fields, including biology, medicine, engineering, and computer science. In this module we'll dive into importing, visualizing, resizing, cropping images. we'll also use some common packages for image classification, object detection and facial comparison. 

Pillow, also known as PIL (Python Imaging Library), is a popular Python library for working with digital images. Pillow provides a wide range of image processing functions, including image filtering, resizing, rotation, cropping, and blending.
