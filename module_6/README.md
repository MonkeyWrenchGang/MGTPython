# Module 6 
----

In this module we are going to dive into Automating our analysis, rather than copy and pasting code we are going to dive into encapsulating our code into functions. Like any good data scientist we want to use automate repetitive tasks in Python using functions and loops.

Functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code into a single entity that can be called from other parts of your program. Functions can take inputs, called arguments, and return outputs, called return values. Functions can help you to write more modular, reusable, and readable code, and can save you time and effort when you need to perform the same task multiple times.

In this module we'll see how we can use loops and functions to automate our code.
