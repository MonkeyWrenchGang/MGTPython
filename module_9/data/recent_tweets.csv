"The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to cover millions more people. That means more cancers detected early, more mental health treatment available, and less medical debt."

"Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which not one Republican in Congress voted for, millions have enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, many saving an average of $800 a year for better coverage at better prices.

Some MAGA Republicans have voted repeatedly to try and repeal it."

"After the strongest two years of job growth and new small business applications in history, I am more optimistic than ever that America’s best days are ahead. https://t.co/VApv5ByOAE"

"I am determined to once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

"While we still have more to do, inflation is now down 30% from what it was this summer, gas prices are down, and take-home pay for workers has gone up."

My budget would build on the progress we've made growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out. It's a plan that keeps investing in American manufacturing and innovation and creates more good-paying jobs that don't require a college degree.
"Because of actions that our regulators have already taken, every American should feel confident their deposits will be there if and when they need them.

The management of these banks will be fired and investors in the banks will not be protected."
"I announced an executive order on gun violence to intensify our work to save lives. It will keep firearms out of dangerous hands, takes every lawful action to move as close to universal background checks without new legislation, expands awareness about red flag laws, and more."
"I am pleased that, in line with my call, Novo Nordisk will be lowering their insulin prices by 75%, following Eli Lilly’s action. 

This builds on the important progress we made last year when I signed a law to cap insulin at $35 for seniors. I urge others to follow."
Today’s report shows annual inflation is down by a third from this summer at a time when the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low. That is the slowest annual increase since September 2021.
"Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe. Your deposits are safe.

We must get the full accounting of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable. No one is above the law."
"During the Obama-Biden administration, we put tough requirements on banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank—including the Dodd-Frank Law to make sure the crisis we saw in 2008 would not happen again.

The last administration rolled back some of these requirements."
"The bottom line is this: Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe, and your deposits are safe. https://t.co/hM36ZmZ22x"

My budget would restore the expanded Child Tax Credit. https://t.co/ezVpOfEgPH
"My budget protects and strengthens Social Security and Medicare.

It rejects any cuts, extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by at least 25 years, and invests in service delivery so seniors and people with disabilities can access the benefits they have earned."
"I'm happy to report that our economy created over 300,000 new jobs last month, on top of half a million jobs we added the month before.

That’s another $200 billion in deficit reduction."
"If the MAGA Republicans get their way, seniors will pay higher out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs and insulin, the deficit will be bigger, and Medicare will be weaker. 

The only winner under their plan will be Big Pharma."
