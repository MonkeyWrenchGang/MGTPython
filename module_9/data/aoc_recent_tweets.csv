Yes, it was hard to follow the details - an unknown PM by the name of Zelensky, military aid, etc. We knew.

The Senate acquitted, and many who claimed the move as politically unnecessary or a “stunt” felt justified. Some claimed it hurt us."
"Eventually, public and internal pressure mounted to such a level that inaction became untenable for leadership and the party.

Impeachment proceeded, with many of the initial resisters then speaking of their importance in the decision (which yes, they were key to!)

However,"
"Our argument was regardless of outcome, someone would be left holding the ball on accountability.

Would we, the House, rather have to answer questions later of why we didn’t act, or have the Senate answer questions of why they acquitted?

The debate was fierce &amp; opposition real."
"Consider this: When we pushed for the 1st impeachment of Trump for illegally withholding aid to Ukraine, initially many Dems internally resisted it.

We were chastised for being “unrealistic,” that the public wouldn’t be able to follow the plot, and that it would lead nowhere. /1"
"Congress must understand that a failure to hold Clarence Thomas accountable sends a loud, dangerous signal to the full Court - Kavanaugh, Barrett, &amp; the rest - that his acts are fair game.

This is a tipping point. Inaction is a decision to erode and further delegitimize SCOTUS."

"100% agree. The Senate must reconvene immediately and bring BBB to a vote regardless of Manchin’s statement.

Either way,midterms-wise much of that is moot if we don’t break filibuster to pass voting rights ASAP"
"@ncweaver Even if you could get 10 Republicans, the problem as I explained above is that there is only 1 vote allowed left this year per Senate rules. It’s not a political problem, it’s a procedure/rules problem."
"That’s also why passing this before the new year was/is so important - delaying could cost us a major item in the President’s agenda next yr.

Unless we break the filibuster. In that case, it could still cost us a recon slot but at least lets us move on voting rights +other items"
"If we only get 2 recon bills per year, and BBB was supposed to be the 2nd recon of 2021, does pushing “roll it over” or does the Senate clock restart in 22, BBB is erased as the 2nd 2021 bill, &amp; Dems now only have 2 swings left instead of 3? Likely the latter but not confirmed"
"What makes the choice to push even more harmful (potentially) is that if BBB gets pushed to next year, it raises the question if that decision effectively erases 1 of Biden’s 4 chances to pass major legislation before the midterms barring action on filibuster -"
"Many folks bring this up,&amp; it’s not a bad idea. The problem is that due to the filibuster, we can’t vote on items individually.

For the most part, the only major leg Senate can pass w/ 51 votes are reconciliation bills. We only get 2 per year. 1st was Rescue Plan, only 1 left https://t.co/TOg2y22SpX"
"We, as always, are here to fight for this agenda. What matters most to us is that it gets done. But we cannot just shrug our shoulders and accept this as some Charlie Brown moment.

Our entire democracy is on the line. So we need to get back in there &amp; get this sh*t done. Period"
"People can be mad at Manchin all they want, but we knew he would do this months ago.

Where we need answers from are the leaders who promised a path on BBB if BIF passed: Biden &amp; Dem leaders. *They* chose to move BIF alone instead of w/ BBB, not Manchin.

So they need to fix it."
"Some of us don’t have the luxury of giving up. We serve working, middle class, &amp; poor people. We serve everyday workers getting ripped off &amp; immigrants &amp; Black communities &amp; queer kids needing shelter. We will not walk away from them. And leadership can’t walk from them either."
"To every member who brought up Manchin, they personally promised they had a solution &amp; BBB would pass.

It is simply not an option for Dem leaders to walk from BBB, voting rights, etc. They must find a way, just as they promised they would when we raised this inevitability"
"Either way, we cannot accept no for an answer. Dem leadership - incl but not limited to the President himself and House Dem leadership - wrote a massive check on their credibility the night of the BIF vote in order to secure the votes they needed, *promising* passage of BBB…"
"When a handful of us in the House warned this would happen if Dem leaders gave Manchin everything he wanted 1st by moving BIF before BBB instead of passing together, many ridiculed our position.

"Leadership forces votes all the time.

The pressure of voting no+ folks@home seeing IS overwhelming. They even force unnecessary standalone votes like the extra Iron Dome $,which actually belongs in Defense $ https://t.co/DEnYcJLDNi"
"To secure votes for the Bipar Infra Bill, Biden *himself* came to House Progressives &amp; told us was putting his credibility on the line to deliver BBB if CPC voted BIF.

They trusted him. I didn’t think he could promise the Senate. He promised anyway. It’s time for him to deliver."
"People want to “but Manchin” everyone to death, but learned helplessness is not a disposition that inspires confidence or support.

The President has tools at his disposal. Leadership has tools at their disposal. If it really is just 1-2 votes, Senate should force a vote on BBB"
"It is actually delusional to believe Dems can get re-elected without acting on filibuster or student debt, Biden breaking his BBB promise, letting CTC lapse, 0 path to citizenship, etc

"“Woke” is a term pundits are now using as a derogatory euphemism for civil rights &amp; justice.

Making up a “woke” problem results in putting civil &amp; voting rights on the backburner. In a year state legislatures are planning out GOP majorities &amp; voter suppression, that’s dangerous"
"One dangerous aspect of thinking there’s a “woke problem” is that Dem chances for re-election or majorities in House, Senate, &amp; WH rely on the racial justice issue of voting rights.

Dems distancing from racial justice makes protection of voting rights less likely,ensuring losses"
@saschasegan @ThesillyDane It was on the table - passing both this week
"We can and should message BIF as a step, but messaging it as a solution alone is going to get us into trouble.

BBB contains the majority of the presidents agenda. We must keep going and ensure the promises are delivered"
"It’s not just that we made these promises before - look at how the infra bill is being messaged *now*

I respect the President and the leg feat he just accomplished. But this is simply wrong. We did not fund the replacement of every child’s pipe &amp; we shouldn’t tell people we did https://t.co/3zpU20o6WR"
"I want to protect our party from the disappointment and collapse in turnout from communities like mine that occurs when we tell them we did things we didn’t do.

We shouldn’t promise all lead pipes will be fixed if that is not the case. Some will, most won’t. We must push for BBB"
"The cost to replace every lead pipe in the United States is $45-60 billion.

BIF only gives $15b. Without BBB, many communities historically denied clean water will continue to be denied.

Build Back Better has lead $ for disadvantaged communities. We must keep pushing for BBB."
"The reason platitudes like this are insulting is bc they are exclusively employed to deny the working class, poc, and youth’s basic demands for livability. Like affordable rx drugs

No one says this to the safe-seat Dems who derailed climate action &amp; healthcare over a CBO table"
"For people who say “don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good” to pass legislation, consider why no one tells that to the Dems who killed passage of Rx drug pricing and Universal Pre-K this week over small process demands from safe Dem seats in places like NY and Hawaii."
"@CalderTheArtist No. The only other option is for the President to sign some climate EOs, but that neither picks the lock nor replaces the key and the option itself is uncertain- the Supreme Court is hearing cases (from WV oil!) to strip Biden’s ability to act via the EPA. https://t.co/OEzQEDJcXw"
"If BBB isn’t delivered w/ BIF’s oil &amp; gas locked in, we’re in trouble. That is what makes it a huge gamble. So again, we need pressure to deliver the promise on BBB

For anyone middle age &amp; younger let’s hope this ain’t Kyoto all over again cause we’re going live w/ the outcome"
"The desire to pass both together isn’t the unnuanced stance some pundits think it is.

BIF has a lot of bad stuff in it - that’s how they got GOP votes. It ALSO has a lot of good stuff in it- what you’re hearing on TV.

Passing BBB unlocks BIF’s climate goods so the good prevails"
"On the issue of climate, think of BIF as a lock 🔐 and BBB as the key 🔑 

Locks only open with keys. BIF climate benefits ONLY unlock with BBB’s 🔑 provisions.

If we msg BIF as good on climate alone when it’s not, we stop the pressure for BBB’s passage. Do not let this happen"
"On Mon/Tues, we were set to pass both bills. The oil and gas lobby was working OVERTIME this week to kill the methane fees in BBB to ensure it didn’t pass with BIF

So for the sake of the planet and everyone younger than a baby boomer let’s pray that leadership delivers their IOU"
"2. Political - there were many, many promises made to get to Friday’s passage. Promises from mod Dems, House leadership, and the President himself.

If those promises do not get fulfilled, it will make future passage of anything much more difficult. BIF will look like a cakewalk"
"The elevated stakes are not just policy, but political.

1. Policy- Passing BIF without BBB is a huge gamble. People will point to pro-climate investments in BIF, but the oil &amp; gas giveaways wipe out its progress to 0 or risk worse emissions. Passing BBB unlocks BIF climate perks"
"Yes. BIF+BBB are not written as 2 distinct bills, but interlocking policy. BIF’s climate benefits only unlock if BBB passes.

If BBB gutted/dies, we may have just locked in US emissions &amp;thrown away our biggest chance to combat climate change. Stakes are now higher on BBB passing https://t.co/nZUgX5yYsh"

@ItsTanbirC @biancagguerrero The handful of NOs can in part act as an accountability mechanism. Many promises were made and pressure is now elevated to deliver on them. If promises aren’t delivered it will risk future trust breakdown &amp; make future votes even harder. So let’s hope that’s enough stakes for BBB
"@ItsTanbirC @biancagguerrero Methane lobby (among others I’m sure) was exerting a LOT of pressure against BBB, trying to delay + reopen for changes. I am very concerned we just locked in US emissions if BBB isn’t delivered. That said there are still incentives to pass BBB, but if gutted our future is at risk"
"@ItsTanbirC @biancagguerrero Chances are lower now, but still exist. Earlier we were set to pass both BIF + BBB this week. Now we don’t know.

Some may think these are 2 totally different bills, but they are drafted to be interlocking. Many BIF climate benefits only unlock if BBB passes. Stakes are very high"

"Last year in CARES alone the corporate bailout was a leveraged value of $4 TRILLION, which is over 2x what we’re trying to invest in BBB over 10 years!

I railed about it at the time and the right wing made a thing about it but I was pissed! Sorry language https://t.co/AtK7PlBO5M"
"And for folks saying “we have inflation because we printed a bunch of money last year”— if you want to trim down needless spending in these bills to addressing inflationary issues, the answer isn’t to cut basic benefits for people.

It’s to target the massive corporate giveaways."
"For people saying this is too out there, read this WSJ coverage.

"My family is one of essential workers: school bus drivers, postal workers, cleaners, etc

When childcare wasn’t available, my family couldn’t work - they stayed home.

When childcare isn’t universally available, it impacts the labor market. It can become a supply chain issue!"
"I haven’t seen data yet if those anecdotes are indicative of a larger trend (&amp; if so, how large), but the point still stands.

Like many working class Latino families,my grandma lived with us growing up and cared for me as my parents worked. Until she moved in, my mom stayed home"
"You can see this in the issue of wages. You will sometimes hear stories of a place claiming to have raised wages but still having trouble keeping people.

Well, when a pandemic devastated intergenerational families of workers and there’s no childcare, people can’t go back to work"
"When people drop out of the workforce, it’s a pretty complicated &amp; expensive endeavor to get them back.

The reason is bc unlike physical supply chain issues where problems are a bit more straightforward (not saying easy, but more clear), labor supply issues can be more complex."
"Conservatives argue against raising wages by claiming it’ll raise prices. But that isn’t reliably supported w historic data.

However, what we’re seeing now is perhaps an ex. of prices rising when wages/benefits are *too low*- not enough workers, hurts supply chain, prices hike."
"If you are worried about inflation, it’s important to understand why it’s happening: supply chain, labor, and healthcare complications. We can address these issues by investing in infrastructure, wages, healthcare &amp;benefits.

"Now for folks who say “you need to compromise”: to start, I do not support blue hydrogen. I am against expanding it.

The compromise is allowing blue hydrogen w/ the drawdown provisions in BBB. Passing blue hydrogen alone without guaranteed drawdowns is not a compromise."
"Passing BIF w/o BBB makes our emissions &amp; climate crisis worse. Sure, some BIF investments do good - but not enough, so it keeps us in the emissions red.

As someone who actually has to live in the future being debated for us: BBB gives us a fighting chance. BIF alone buries us."
"You know where Blue hydrogen comes from? Fracked gas. Blue hydrogen has worse emissions than coal, locks in more powerful climate destruction than what we’re doing now.

Blue is bad. (Grey too)

Guess which one bipar bill finances? Blue. So we need to mitigate that BIF alone harm"
"People will say “oh look at all this money in climate - like hydrogen energy!”

Well, not all hydrogen is the same. The H sources matter. There are 3 kinds: blue, green, and grey.

Green hydrogen is the good stuff: that hydrogen comes from water and helps us draw down emissions."
"Details matter.

A lot of people don’t know what the “bipartisan” bill consists of (despite text) and why it’s critical that Build Back Better be paired with it.

And it’s not only pensions. Univ endowments can divest, too.

Want to help? Ask your school or pension to divest from fossil fuels &amp; into climate😉🌎"
"That’s where workers come in to spark change. By demanding their retirements be divested of fossil fuels, workers and voters are precipitating large shifts of $ out of big oil, gas,etc.

That amps up pressure &amp; leaves companies like Exxon w/ fewer places to get fossil fuel money."
"I sit on the Financial Services Cmte &amp; often see how Wall St leverages risky &amp;/or unpopular investments onto public pensions, taking bets and setting up workers to hold the bag.

"Quitting being UI ineligible aside, the idea that laziness is why ppl stay home contradicts the “free market ideals” these folks pretend to champion.

"That’s why it’s so important to discuss this not just in numbers, but in changes to the leg.

Let’s say we bring down $3.5T. We can do that by taxing the rich to offset, cutting universal pre-k, or shortening the funding time.

All can bring outlay down. Which one do you prefer?"
