# Frameworks in Python
----

Scikit-learn, also known as sklearn, is a widely used machine learning library AND FRAMEWORK in Python that provides a framework for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and model evaluation.

Scikit-learn includes a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, including popular methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forests, and k-means clustering.

Scikit-learn is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for working with data and building machine learning models. Scikit-learn also includes tools for data preprocessing, such as scaling, normalization, and feature selection, which can help you to prepare your data for machine learning algorithms.

Or course model building is beyond the scope of this course, but i want you to see a framework in action.
