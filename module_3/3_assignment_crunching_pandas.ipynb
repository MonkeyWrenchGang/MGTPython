        "You have been hired to lead a data science team for a food delivery service. There have been a number of recent complaints posted to yelp about late deliveries from your service. In an effort to better serve customers, your team has been tasked with creating a model to predict which deliveries are likely to be delivered late (delivery_status = 1) and on-time (delivery_status = 0). To do this your data scientists have gathered historic delivery data, identified which deliveries have been delivered late and on-time, they created a model and scored the data with the probability of late delivery (predict_proba) and created an indicator of their predicted outcome (predict_status). Your challenge is to analyze the data, understand what factors are likely to be important when making deliveries and which aren’t. Finally, you’ll need to explain to the executives the accuracy, precision and recall of your team’s model, as well as come up with a strategy to take advantage of the model to improve customer delivery experience. \n",
